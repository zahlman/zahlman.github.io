# Present

This is a difficult post to write, largely because of the self-critique involved. In all honesty, I've been putting it off for months, at least in part because of that.

But putting it off has only made it harder to write. I also seem to have reached a point where it psychologically feels impossible to publish anything else here first. So, I'm finally forcing myself to write it now - during the holiday season, to prove to myself that I can.

# Past

I can still recall a morning near the end of this June where I woke up at some ungodly hour, with this strange sense of determination to... clean up my computer desktop.

In the process, I noticed a file sitting there, named `TODO.txt`.

"It's empty, isn't it," I thought. A statement, not a question.

I checked. It was empty. Of course, the intent was clear. I simply had never gotten around to filling in any TODO items - despite all the time that I'd spent vaguely thinking about them, mentally categorizing them, angsting over my repeated failure to engage with them, and of course not actually doing them.

Perhaps I should have put something in it right away. Even just "write something here". I don't really know why I didn't.

"How long ago did I make this?"

I checked. As I recall, it was somewhere near the end of March 2023, around the time of my [first](/python-standard-library/2023/04/06/timing.html) [attempts](/meta/2023/04/09/ah-yes-im-back-by-the-way.html) to write anything here beyond the initial [welcome message](/meta/2022/03/02/welcome.html). Which, of course, were promptly followed by *another* hiatus of over a year.

[In 2022](https://github.com/zahlman?tab=overview&from=2022-12-01&to=2022-12-31), I had made a New Years' resolution to write and commit some code every day. I came up with a bunch of ideas and made several little toys - some of which still seem like good ideas which I might pick up again, or which at least serve as a useful prototype. I wasn't perfect, but I was doing a pretty good job through January and February.

Then I set up the blog, feeling ready to build upon that momentum.

Only to promptly drop everything, fall into what seemed to be depression, get sick, and ultimately do nothing of note until May (when I [participated](https://github.com/AcidCubeGames/RodOneOut) in a [local game jam](https://www.tojam.ca/) with a friend of mine).

When I finally convinced myself to blog again - after several stops and starts at coding, and looking for other ways to appear productive online - I really felt ready to get back into a regular schedule.

And then I didn't.

As I stared at `TODO.txt` on my desktop, I again felt that motivation. July of 2024 represented yet another chance at a fresh start.

And then, after only a few days of procrastination, I found myself wrapped up in that [PSF brouhaha](politics/the-psf/2024/07/31/an-open-letter-to-the-psf-coc-wg.html) that led to my [ban](/dpo_archive) from the [official Python Discourse forum](https://discuss.python.org) and eventually to [Tim Peters' suspension from core development](politics/the-psf/2024/08/10/open-letter-psf-coc-wg-addendum-1-tim-peters.html) (about which he has also [written extensively](https://tim-one.github.io/psf/)).

When I got banned, I wrote up an initial draft for my first post promptly - the next day, July 20 - but decided to let cooler heads prevail. It was about 4000 words that flowed effortlessly, eventually cut down to 3000 words with much more effort. I really didn't want the end of the month to pass without saying anything, so I took the time on July 31 to get it all hammered out.

And of course, there was plenty I could have written about in the interim - such as this very topic - but I just didn't.

As I waited through Mr. Peters' suspension - also taking note of the [Python 3.13 release](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3130/) and [Pip 24.3 release](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/#v24-3-1), which of course suggested yet-unwritten blog posts of their own - I found myself again devoting more time to asking myself why I wasn't blogging, and even time to drafting articles - but still none to finishing anything off and posting it.

At least I haven't been idle the last few months. The time that I would have spent helping people on the Discourse forum is now largely taken up on [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com) and the Linux Mint forums - and a lot of my comments in both places have been about technical Python-related material that I'll surely write about here eventually.

# Future

But I've come to realize that this really isn't an efficient use of my time (and neither was most of what I was writing on the Discourse forum). Posting like that proves to me that I do really enjoy writing on these topics (as well as others that I'd prefer to skip here), but helping someone troubleshoot a problem on a forum generally only helps that person. Even if I write, say, a guide or a tutorial or other useful information that helps people understand Python packaging, it's only useful if people who need that information can find it.

With a blog, I can at least refer people to past articles instead of rewriting explanations. And with luck, eventually other people will start linking them, too. For reasons I'll have to cover separately, I no longer write questions or answers on Stack Overflow - but I do edit content there. I do, in principle, write Q&A pairs [on Codidact](https://codidact.com), and I hope to get back into that in the new year.

But for now, I'm focusing on the blog, and on the code projects I currently find most important - a replacement for Pip and Pipx called Paper (still in planning), and a [build backend for Python packaging called `bbbb`](https://github.com/zahlman/bbbb/). (Please don't mind the broken link in the README. During my various attempts to get back into coding in the last few months, I set up some new-project tooling with a template that doesn't quite suit my current workflow. At least not until I get up to speed on [RTD](https://about.readthedocs.com/). In its current state, the project is technically usable, but perhaps only by me.)

My next post will be a more detailed list of programming projects I'm either planning, working on, or have worked on in the past. Not everything (that would stretch beyond and before my GitHub history - although I do have archives of at least some of the code I wrote as a child), but the things that currently seem relevant. Originally I planned to include such a list here, but splitting it up will probably make the effort more sustainable.

My plan is for that to appear next week, along with several more posts. In more detail, my plan is to, once again, "do something" every day, because daily habits seem to be easier to form than less regular or frequent ones. But I'm adopting a bit more structure this time:

* Every Saturday and Sunday, I intend to either write some code, or do something that helps improve the blog (draft future content, brainstorm or organize article ideas, polish up theming or miscellaneous content, etc.)

* Every weekday, I intend to either publish a blog article or (starting next year) a self-answered Q&A on Codidact covering some important topic (links to which will also be collected here).

These are expected minimums I'm setting for myself. I won't hold myself back from coding on a blog day or vice-versa if I feel up to it. But neither will I allow myself to take a failure as an excuse to abandon the project.

You don't have to believe I'll follow through with this, but I hope you'll see that I do. I have an awful lot of a backlog, so I imagine that I can find enough material to write like this for quite some time.

And now that I have it written down, I can tell myself "for real, this time".
