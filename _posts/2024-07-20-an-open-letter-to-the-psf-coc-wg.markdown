## Epilogue

Being cut off from my account means I have lost access to a huge collection of bookmarks for posts about the problem with packaging in Python. So it will take me that much longer to say productive, useful things that could actually help Python developers. Unfortunate.

On the bright side, I anticipated that I would be subjected to some kind of interference like this, so I locally saved all the posts I was making about this topic, as I posted them. That which has been "flagged by the community and is temporarily hidden" (and to be clear, I don't imagine for a second that you have any intention of restoring any of it, even though no reasonable person could possibly find that it violates the Code of Conduct as written) is not lost; I will repost it all here on my blog in due time. Make no mistake - I am *not even remotely* finished with this issue.

## To set the record straight

1. I **absolutely did not, in any way, shape or form**, claim that moderation actions taken against me "were an example of reverse racism". This is so far removed from my claims that no reasonable, rational person acting in good faith could conceivably say such a thing. In point  of fact, I **rejected the very concept** behind this term, and pointed out that people with my belief system **do not use it** - people who ideologically align with the WG use it, in order to mock and dismiss obvious and serious real-world harms. Further, I barely mentioned racism anyway, choosing to focus on sexism instead. But above all, **nothing I said** about this utterly nonsensical term **had anything to do with objections to moderation actions taken against me**. I was very explicit about that - this point was *specifically* about the enforcement policy in the abstract. That is, I pointed out that you reject claims about sexism against men (*the actual term for it*) out of hand, as inherently invalid. (That is: **the concept which you mislabel is in fact abundantly evidenced**, contrary to your assertions.) You then somehow turned this into an accusation of such sexism.

1. **Neither I nor Dr. Mertz "attacked"** (a word that is consciously chosen to create a false impression of threat to physical safety - a ludicrous notion on the Internet) "the forum staff, the COC WG, the PSF in general" or anyone else. We *criticized your actions*. Because they merit criticism. At no point did we make any kind of insulting or disparaging remark, nor accuse you of anything I couldn't prove. Anyway, to suppose that this has anything to do with a failure to "acknowledge time and effort" is so utterly ridiculous that I genuinely can't think of a meaningful response.

1. **There is objectively nothing wrong**, in any reasonably governed community, with "explicit voicing of lack of trust against moderator actions". Aside from which, we already established that "getting our posts hidden" *is not* a "moderator action". Regardless, by saying such a thing, you effectively **admit to intent to run a dictatorship and stifle dissent**. Or, as you put it, intent to expect users to "gracefully accept constructive criticism". Amazing. Just to be perfectly clear: **there is no possible "constructive criticism"** involved in censoring someone else without comment.

1. **It is abundantly clear that you do not care in the slightest about "empathy"**. You don't show any for me; you don't show any for neurodivergent individuals generally; you don't show any for members of groups that aren't on your list of approved recipients of empathy. So it is hypocritical in the extreme to accuse me of a "pattern" of failure to "show empathy towards other community members" - in fact I have gone out of my way on a regular basis to ensure such empathy to the best of my ability.

1. Dr. Mertz **did not in any way, shape or form** "defend the use of a derogatory term used against women". To say so is to ignore [one of the most basic tenets of logic and philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use%E2%80%93mention_distinction) (by the way, what do you suppose is the subject of Dr. Mertz's PhD?), But more than that, **it is outright defamatory** to make such a claim. Anyway, do you suppose that women are supposedly *inherently* harmed by the mere act of *seeing* certain words in print? I am not a sexist, so I don't imagine women to be so fragile. What's your excuse?

1. Dr. Mertz **disagreed** with you regarding changes to the PSF bylaws. That was **not, in any way, shape or form, a "refusal to accept"** those opinions. On the contrary, he provided evidence that **you** are the ones who show disrespect to dissenting opinions - for example, Ms. Nanjekye's. Aside from that, Dr. Mertz showed the *utmost* "respect for differing viewpoints and experiences". But you did not respect his.

1. When you say that the WG's gender, "ethnic, cultural, economical, and religious" diversity "provides the working group with excellent representation of differing viewpoints", you are inherently supposing such immutable traits of individuals necessarily cause them to *have* such differing viewpoints. **That is both bigoted and demonstrably false**.

1. Your "busy" week (amounting to approximately one (1) flag per moderator, per day) does not in any way excuse such ignorance of the truth.

## How I got involved

Though I do not wish to speak for them, it is clear that our grievances have a common root: the [aftermath](https://discuss.python.org/t/inclusive-communications-expectations-in-python-spaces/57950) of discussion of a then-upcoming PSF vote on changes to bylaws. The measures proposed in [that discussion](https://discuss.python.org/t/for-your-consideration-proposed-bylaws-changes-to-improve-our-membership-experience/55696) (also, to my understanding, discussed on a members-only mailing list, and possibly also on some Discord servers that I don't know anything about) have since [all passed](https://discuss.python.org/t/psf-board-election-proposed-bylaws-changes-results-announcement/58465) - despite quite a bit of opposition voiced in that discussion, the most controversial measure received over 80% votes in favour.

But it's certainly not the measure itself that got me upset enough to leave. No, that was the result of the aftermath thread linked above, and several things said in that thread, mainly by other core devs.

I didn't habitually read the PSF section of the forum, because I've never been a PSF member. But for whatever reason, the forum software suggested the aftermath thread to me, and I had a look at the OP, which proposed that the following "not okay" things had transpired:

> Bringing up examples of sexual harassment and making light of workplace sexual harassment training.

> Utilizing emojis and turns of phrase in ways that can be misconstrued or perceived entirely differently by different people.

> Resisting soft conduct moderation when people point out problematic statements in what has been said.

That first charge seems quite serious, and the others are at least intriguing, and the prior forum thread was also linked right there. Since I don't (and didn't) have access to the PSF-vote mailing list, I could only rely on the linked thread for information.

We were also reminded that

> We expect everyone to uphold an inclusive communication standard in the Python community, regardless of your tenure, stature, reputation, or history with the project.

and informed that

> Some communication styles that were unfortunately common in the past are rightfully recognized as inappropriate today.

strongly implying that someone of considerable reputation - someone from the "old guard", so to speak - was being called out.

Between those contextual clues and the content of the thread, it was quite easy to suss out what this was supposedly about. And it was furthermore quite obvious to me that this was a smear job.

## Math, science, history

I don't like smear jobs. Especially not when they're directed at personal heroes like [Tim Peters](https://github.com/tim-one).

And for me personally, I first got to interact with Mr. Peters [on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21297887/), on a question related to sorting, receiving praise for my answer. You can imagine how star-struck I was.

Anyway, the ensuing replies neatly confirmed my suspicions - after two of the sort of sycophantic replies that one should always expect for this sort of business, came Mr. Peters' [highly well-spoken objections](https://discuss.python.org/t/inclusive-communications-expectations-in-python-spaces/57950/4), followed by pointing out the [chilling effect](https://discuss.python.org/t/inclusive-communications-expectations-in-python-spaces/57950/6) that the Code of Conduct Working Group (as well as the Steering Council - it turns out that Python community governance is rather complex) has had on discussion. He also managed to scratch the surface of the hypocrisy that the WG has demonstrated in enforcing the CoC.

It turns out that I also don't like hypocrisy. I very, very much dislike it (I also dislike strained attempts to claim hypocrisy on the part of someone who has actually been quite consistent). So at that point I tripped and fell down the rabbit hole, and spent a good portion of my waking hours for an entire week unraveling the mystery of how things had gotten to this point -  where there could be such political tensions within the PSF, and so much energy to find fault with pillars of the community.

## Just for the record

And most importantly, let me explain the understanding I arrived at of Mr. Peters' supposed sins:

* The "example" of sexual harassment he "brought up" was nothing at all about the harassment itself, but a simple statement that executives at places where he'd previously worked had been accused of it.

* He supposedly "made light of workplace sexual harassment training" by pointing out that it's the workers who tend to receive it, rather than the executives thus accused. (Although he referred to it as "sexual harassment prevention training", believing reasonably that the other term sounds like it should mean rather the opposite.)

* "Utilizing emojis and turns of phrase in ways that can be misconstrued" refers to inserting a wink emoji (the 😉 character, which has special support in the forum software) into posts.

* "Resisting soft conduct moderation" entails standing up for neurodivergent individuals, continuing to talk about topics from posts that had been anonymously flagged (for absolutely no rational reason I can fathom), critiquing previous moderation decisions, and refusing (correctly, in my view) to accept that he had done something wrong. Or at least, that's the best I can make of it. The only clear example of "soft conduct moderation" I could find in the thread was Carol Willing's request "that the rehashing of sexual terms here and on the mailing list cease" - **and it did cease immediately**.

## And then it got worse

The treatment of Tim Peters in this disgusting excuse for "discussion" was already bad enough to make up my mind - I was out. But it was worse than that.

Further horrible things were said about Mr. Peters, Mr. Holden and Dr. Mertz.

And as I kept writing responses - doing my utmost to keep my cool - and reading background, I discovered the "enforcement procedures", whereupon the penny dropped.

## The PSF Code of Conduct does not mean what it says

It *cannot* mean what it says, because it preaches fairness and equal treatment for everyone, but is enforced - necessarily and by policy - in a blatantly biased manner.

I knew that the wording had been inspired by a lot of previous Codes of Conduct, ultimately tracing back in places to work by such... luminaries as Sage Sharp and Coraline Ada Ehmke. But it seemed sound and reasonable in its literal wording, so I didn't initially check any further.

But the enforcement of this policy demands a worldview wherein harm that befalls men or white people doesn't count... because reasons; and where neurodiversity doesn't matter worth a damn; and where challenges to the claim that intersectional feminism is the only legitimate approach to gender etc. equality, are somehow inherently offensive.

And I saw from previous discussions that a significant fraction of important people in the community have swallowed all of these ideas wholesale.

And I saw that, on the other hand, it is perfectly within the WG's interpretation of "being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences", "showing empathy towards other community members" and "using welcoming and inclusive language" to *insinuate that someone else is a fascist bigot* who needs to be [paradox of tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance)'d out of the community for the high crime of not wanting to voice affirmative support for specific supposedly "anti-racist" organizations like BLM.

Did I mention I don't like hypocrisy? I don't like intellectual dishonesty, either.

## Coming to a head

As you can probably imagine, I was increasingly upset by all of this - enough to inspire quite a bit of critical posting.

But I never violated the Code of Conduct as it is written. I was absolutely respectful to others. I did not use slurs, nor any kind of insulting epithets, nor profanity. I was challenged to defend my views, so I did - bringing appropriate evidence. I took utmost care at all times to ensure that I only expressed my hurt, and not my anger.

One of my own posts got auto-hidden by community flags as "offensive", apparently because I dared to suggest that bad things happen to men that aren't the fault of other men, and that feminists commonly blame men for those things. (I also dared to point out a phenomenon that media insists on painting as a women's issue even though it objectively happens more than twice as often to men.) And at the same time, my [thread](https://discuss.python.org/t/im-leaving-too/58408) was put into a 12-hour slow mode. (I'm assuming the latter was done by you, Mr. Langa, simply because your name is attached to every other externally-verifiable moderation action in this mess.)

And when I found that I couldn't edit the hidden post to bring it back (the slow-mode limit counts against that, you see), I resolved to fix it the next day.

## The next day

And that brings us back to the beginning.

I went back to my browser tab with the forum open, with the plan of restoring my post (on the advice of some others, including Mr. Peters) and then challenging Hugo van Kemenade's misinformation about the mass exodus of core developers in late 2020. (By the way, Mr. Langa, I thank you for showing me the exact resource needed to debunk that narrative - again, a matter for a separate post.)

I didn't get the chance. When I came back, I found that I had been logged out, and couldn't log back in. You were in the middle of a spree of locking threads, posting official mod messages and "indefinitely suspending" (i.e., banning) accounts - specifically, mine and Dr. Mertz's. Plus there was a new banner on the site promoting new ["community guidelines"](https://discuss.python.org/guidelines/) which had come seemingly out of nowhere.

I did not receive a forum email about this, but I was able to gather that [I](https://discuss.python.org/u/kknechtel/summary) - the first recipient of the forum's [gold "Empathetic" badge](https://discuss.python.org/badges/39/empathetic) outside of the core Python dev team - had been deemed "too combative" for this environment.

"You can't quit; you're fired". Very well then.

The truly amazing part, to me, is that a few hours before this moderation, you found time to [revive](https://github.com/pypi/support/issues/2771#issuecomment-2239047177) the very GitHub issue that motivated me to join the forum in the first place, which went ignored by the woefully inadequate volunteer resources of PyPI (to be fair, this seems to have been left almost entirely on the shoulders of Dustin Ingram - who incidentally [recently became a PSF Fellow](https://www.python.org/psf/fellows/)) for over a year until this very day.

But the truly *offensive* part is the pair of messages, about [me](https://discuss.python.org/t/im-leaving-too/58408/11) and [Dr. Mertz](https://discuss.python.org/t/why-i-am-withdrawing-fellowship-status-in-psf/58301/4), that you relayed from the WG.

## Introductions

Dear Mr. Langa:

I'm sure you haven't forgotten me already; but for the benefit of onlookers, a brief introduction. I am Karl Knechtel: a Pythonista with close to 20 years of experience using Python (and further experience with other languages); semi-active [curator of Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/523612) and [Q&A author on Codidact](https://software.codidact.com/users/64656); and from a bit over a year ago until now, [one of the most prolific users](https://discuss.python.org/u/kknechtel/summary) of the [official Discourse forum for Python](https://discuss.python.org).

Also for the benefit of onlookers, and to give credit where it's due: [Łukasz Langa](https://github.com/ambv) is a member of the Python core development team and release manager for versions 3.8 and 3.9, the largest [contributor to `black`](https://github.com/psf/black/graphs/contributors) (the best-known code style linting tool for Python) and a moderator of said Discourse forum ([although the moderator listing does not appear to be visible to the general public](https://discuss.python.org/g/moderators)).

And just to disambiguate (since "Explicit is better than implicit", but it would have made the title excessively long): the PSF is the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/), whose [Code of Conduct (CoC)](https://policies.python.org/python.org/code-of-conduct/) is [enforced](https://policies.python.org/python.org/code-of-conduct/Enforcement-Procedures/) by a "Working Group (WG)" everywhere that one might expect to encounter the core development team or related important people: at PyCon and other similar live events; on GitHub issue trackers for CPython (the reference implementation of Python) as well as important libraries [under the PSF's umbrella](https://github.com/psf)and [packaging tools maintained by the Python Packaging Authority (PyPA)](https://github.com/pypa), on Discord servers for PSF working groups; on IRC, mailing lists (yes, they still use those), the official Python wiki (did you know there [is one](https://wiki.python.org/moin/)?) - and, of course,  the aforementioned Discourse forum.

There is an *awful* lot to explain here, Mr. Langa, and I hope you will excuse me for addressing most of it to the audience. But to give a brief summary: in banning me, you and the Working Group have acted unjustly and with astounding hypocrisy; in your parting statement you and the Working Group misrepresent my position in egregious and indefensible ways; the ideology you have espoused with these actions is fundamentally corrupt and enables serious real-world harm; and you cannot silence me.

Any of you who have been following this story, may prefer to skip to the last section. I won't fault anyone for that.

Dear onlooker, if you have used Python, you have almost certainly heard of Tim Peters, even if the name eludes you. Let me refresh your memory. If you have ever sorted a list with its `.sort` method, or produced a sorted copy of anything sortable with the built-in `sorted`, you have used the [Timsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort) algorithm that Mr. Peters developed over 20 years ago - a pragmatic, hand-tuned algorithm so good in practice that it was later adapted to several other languages and environments, even much newer ones. If you have ever tried `import this` at a Python interpreter prompt, you have read his work, the [Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/). If you've heard of classic Python books like the [Python Cookbook](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-cookbook/0596001673/) (which I mentioned [in a previous blog article](https://zahlman.github.io/python-standard-library/2023/04/06/timing.html)), he's in there. And in [Learning Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-python/1565924649/) (by Mark Lutz and David Ascher), he's [*personally* listed](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-python/1565924649/apas07.html) as a "useful resource for the Python programmer" in Appendix A.

This morning (in my time zone; I imagine it must have been afternoon for you - and technically yesterday morning, by the time I publish this) I awoke with the plan of continuing the business of [saying my good-byes](https://discuss.python.org/t/im-leaving-too/) from the forum. My departure was not some random, independent act: [Steve Holden](https://github.com/holdenweb) - a former PSF Chair and Director, with an [even longer](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-dev@python.org/message/LN42NRJJ2D6FWHPZ6F4IBVJQSMLZFG3Y/) documented history of using Python - also [announced](https://discuss.python.org/t/why-im-leaving-discuss-python-org/58093) intent to leave the forum; and [David Mertz](https://github.com/davidmertz) - who has been using Python [since antiquity](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/better-python-code/9780138320997/pref06.xhtml), has published multiple books about Python, trains Python programmers at [KDM Training](https://gnosis.cx/kdm/) and was formerly a PSF Director and Fellow - [renounced Fellowship status](https://discuss.python.org/t/why-i-am-withdrawing-fellowship-status-in-psf/58301). Indeed, I followed suit after them.

In the original thread, Joannah Nanjekye - another Python core dev, and as far as I am able to discern, the only female core dev who is not white - opposed the controversial motion, and her arguments were brushed off and she was generally not respected. There was also discussion about how the PSF had previously [failed in adequately funding PyCon events in Africa and helping them run smoothly](https://pythonafrica.blogspot.com/2023/12/an-open-letter-to-python-software_5.html) (Note that the linked article, also an "open letter", is signed by Ms. Nanjekye, and was shared in the discussion by Dr. Mertz.)

## Further reading

There's an awful lot I could say about that discussion, as well as about previous threads. All of that is far out of scope for what I want to talk about in this post - not to worry, for those who are actually interested in my blog, more will follow. For now, let me just link a few of the more interesting threads I uncovered:

[Howto engage Python contributors in the long term?](https://discuss.python.org/t/_/771)

[The PSF should be less political, not more](https://discuss.python.org/t/_/4329)

[Discussion about recent CoC events](https://discuss.python.org/t/_/5778)

I entreat all who read this to look at those threads as well, and draw their own respective conclusions. The old mailing list discussion does not thread as neatly, but [this search result](https://www.mail-archive.com/search?l=python-dev%40python.org&q=amend+pep+strunk&x=0&y=0) will also produce quite a bit of insight into how PSF members think about, and expect each other to think about, issues surrounding the Code of Conduct, as well as matters of what is broadly termed "social justice".
