I'm truly grateful for all such support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven't seen that post yet, please take a moment to read it first. It gives important context (such as explanations of acronyms), which I will not be repeating here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 7, Python core developer Tim Peters was issued a 3-month (although it ended November 1, perhaps due to a clerical error) suspension from that role, accompanied by a suspension from the &lt;a href="https://discuss.python.org"&gt;official Python Discourse forum&lt;/a&gt;. This was connected to my own (permanent) ban from that forum (issued July 19), a fact which other sources have largely ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I describe key events between those two dates, tell my story, and respond to the charges laid against Mr. Peters (spoiler: I find them ludicrous).&lt;/p&gt;

I was already voluntarily about to leave, so I don't particularly mind losing access - but it was nevertheless unjust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the manner in which this was handled shocks and appalls me. In my estimation, the WG has acted with &lt;em&gt;astounding&lt;/em&gt; hypocrisy, which I will allude to in this post and attempt to elucidate in later posts. In announcing my ban, they made a parting statement which misrepresents my position in egregious and indefensible ways. Further, it is my considered opinion that these actions reflect a "social justice" ideology which is neither just nor eusocial - one which I believe is fundamentally corrupt and enables serious real-world harm.&lt;/p&gt;
