&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today (although this won't go live until the 25th in my time zone) is three years since the day I finally kicked Windows to the curb and installed Linux on my home desktop. I'd used Linux before, but all my life I'd had a habit of just using whatever OS was provided to me, without really giving it much thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late 2021, Windows Update told me - entirely unprompted - that my system didn't meet minimum specs to run Windows 11. (Perhaps it would now - I understand that the declared requirements have been relaxed, even if nothing has been optimized or stripped down - but I don't care to check. I'm also told that people still on Windows 10 are under increasing pressure to switch, even though they're &lt;a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2508289/windows-11-market-share-grows-but-windows-10-still-twice-as-popular.html"&gt;still comfortably in the majority&lt;/a&gt; - unless something has radically changed in the last few months.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this impolite - as I hadn't asked, and didn't consider anything wrong or inadequate about my computer - and a bit absurd (whatever they're offering now that requires more computing power, I'm not interested; especially not if it's anything to do with Cortana). So I took that as my queue to switch. I bought a new SSD (figuring I would need the space anyway) and attempted to set up a dual boot - GRUB never worked properly for me, but I could still use the BIOS screen to boot Windows from the old SSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I never looked back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I'd like to relate a few anecdotes about that experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today's post is about a folder on my desktop named &lt;code&gt;dev&lt;/code&gt;. It's where I've kept (for many years, well into my Windows-using days, even into the era when I used SVN rather than Git) all my working copies for my own projects (and forks of others'), mostly Python code of course. (I'm not sure how I organized things at the time, but there are projects in there dating back to 2006.)&lt;/p&gt;

Which is part of why I've been putting it off. For months, if I'm honest with myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But putting it off has only made it harder to write. I also seem to have reached a point where it psychologically feels impossible to publish anything else here first. So, I'm finally forcing myself to write it now - during the holiday season, to prove to myself that I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's no secret that the history of this blog so far has been dominantly one of false starts. Please allow me a moment to explain how that came to be.&lt;/p&gt;

I see it's been another 13 months since my previous posts - hopefully I can break that pattern this year. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy"&gt;Fittingly&lt;/a&gt;, it feels like I've discovered some profound answers in the past year, and yet I'm still left with lots of research to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had originally planned to write about this for the module's 19th anniversary - as my second post on this blog - before I got distracted from the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;given that it &lt;em&gt;actually was&lt;/em&gt; my second post on this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
