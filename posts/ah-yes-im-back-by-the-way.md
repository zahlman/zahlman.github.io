# Ah yes, I'm back, by the way #meta #personal ?2023-04-09

Attentive readers of my previous post may have found the following bit odd:

> I had originally planned to write about this for the module's 19th anniversary - as my second post on this blog - before I got distracted from the project.

given that it *actually was* my second post on this blog.

### Changelog

**January 1, 2025**: Added this meta section, and a heading (immediately below) for the rest of the article after the teaser.

## The plan

As hinted there, it was definitely never my plan to go a year or more between posts. Now that I have committed to starting up again, my current plan is to post three times a week:

* Sundays, something of personal interest
* Tuesdays, something about Stack Overflow
* Thursdays, something about programming in general (especially in Python)

My guess is that a higher frequency (originally, I planned on posting weekly) will give me less time to forget about the task or otherwise get distracted like last time, and more opportunities to reinforce in my mind that regular blog posts are now an Official Part of my Life. Once the plan has been abandoned, it is apparently *very* hard to get started again.

Originally I had planned to write a comeback post with much more detail, including teasers for future articles and a lengthy explanation of why I was away so long and what I got up to in that time. However, I don't think this is really productive. Talking too much about doing things is apparently a very easy way to get distracted from actually doing them. Several old drafts of that comeback post went unpublished, as I kept making up excuses for myself, or backing out of it from... some sort of anxiety? I don't really know. Anyway, I still have the notes.
