After many years of trying to share wisdom on discussion forums, social media and Stack Overflow, I finally got around to starting a blog. I'll be talking about my experiences as a programmer, mainly with Python specifically.

Since I'm also passionate about teaching programming, I'll also be trying to give insight into the process of learning Python, and teaching Python. Later I also intend to include some articles aimed at troubleshooting specific, common problems that beginners have - in a format like Stack Overflow, except that I get to control the questions as well. My long term goal is to write a book.
