# One or more folders containing galleries. The format is a dictionary of
# {"source": "relative_destination"}, where galleries are looked for in
# "source/" and the results will be located in
# "OUTPUT_PATH/relative_destination/gallery_name"
# Default is:
# GALLERY_FOLDERS = {"galleries": "galleries"}
# More gallery options:
# THUMBNAIL_SIZE = 180
# MAX_IMAGE_SIZE = 1280
# USE_FILENAME_AS_TITLE = True
# EXTRA_IMAGE_EXTENSIONS = []

# Use a thumbnail (defined by ".. previewimage:" in the gallery's index) in
# list of galleries for each gallery
GALLERIES_USE_THUMBNAIL = False

# Image to use as thumbnail for those galleries that don't have one
# None: show a grey square
# '/url/to/file': show the image in that url
GALLERIES_DEFAULT_THUMBNAIL = None

# If set to False, it will sort by filename instead. Defaults to True
# GALLERY_SORT_BY_DATE = True

# If set to True, EXIF data will be copied when an image is thumbnailed or
# resized. (See also EXIF_WHITELIST)
# PRESERVE_EXIF_DATA = False

# If you have enabled PRESERVE_EXIF_DATA, this option lets you choose EXIF
# fields you want to keep in images. (See also PRESERVE_EXIF_DATA)
#
# For a full list of field names, please see here:

#
# This is a dictionary of lists. Each key in the dictionary is the
# name of a IDF, and each list item is a field you want to preserve.
# If you have a IDF with only a '*' item, *EVERY* item in it will be
# preserved. If you don't want to preserve anything in a IDF, remove it
# from the setting. By default, no EXIF information is kept.
# Setting the whitelist to anything other than {} implies
# PRESERVE_EXIF_DATA is set to True
# To preserve ALL EXIF data, set EXIF_WHITELIST to {"*": "*"}

# EXIF_WHITELIST = {}

# Some examples of EXIF_WHITELIST settings:

# Basic image information:
# EXIF_WHITELIST['0th'] = [
#    "Orientation",
#    "XResolution",
#    "YResolution",
# ]

# If you want to keep GPS data in the images:
# EXIF_WHITELIST['GPS'] = ["*"]

# Embedded thumbnail information:
# EXIF_WHITELIST['1st'] = ["*"]

# If set to True, any ICC profile will be copied when an image is thumbnailed or
# resized.
# PRESERVE_ICC_PROFILES = False

# Folders containing images to be used in normal posts or pages.
# IMAGE_FOLDERS is a dictionary of the form {"source": "destination"},
# where "source" is the folder containing the images to be published, and
# "destination" is the folder under OUTPUT_PATH containing the images copied
# to the site. Thumbnail images will be created there as well.

# To reference the images in your posts, include a leading slash in the path.
# For example, if IMAGE_FOLDERS = {'images': 'images'}, write
#
#   .. image:: /images/tesla.jpg
#
# See the Nikola Handbook for details (in the “Embedding Images” and
# “Thumbnails” sections)

# Images will be scaled down according to IMAGE_THUMBNAIL_SIZE and MAX_IMAGE_SIZE
# options, but will have to be referenced manually to be visible on the site
# (the thumbnail has ``.thumbnail`` added before the file extension by default,
# but a different naming template can be configured with IMAGE_THUMBNAIL_FORMAT).
# Panoramas (aspect ratio over 3:1) get 4x larger thumbnails due to scaling issues.

IMAGE_FOLDERS = {'images': 'images'}
# IMAGE_THUMBNAIL_SIZE = 400
# IMAGE_THUMBNAIL_FORMAT = '{name}.thumbnail{ext}'
