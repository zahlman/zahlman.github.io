# When linking posts to social media, Nikola provides Open Graph metadata
# which is used to show a nice preview. This includes an image preview
# taken from the post's previewimage metadata field.
# This option lets you use an image to be used if the post doesn't have it.
# The default is None, valid values are URLs or output paths like
# "/images/foo.jpg"
# DEFAULT_PREVIEW_IMAGE = None

# HTML for social buttons (translatable).
# Will probably want something eventually.
# Maybe hit counters can go here?
