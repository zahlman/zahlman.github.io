This is a list of some posts I made on the Python Discourse forum at https://discuss.python.org (hereafter "DPO"), leading up to [my ban on July 19, 2024](/politics/the_psf/2024-07-31/an-open-letter-to-the-psf-coc-wg.html). Before I was banned, I saved the original Markdown source of my posts locally, expecting some interference.

DPO uses the Discourse forum software, wherein the bulk of post formatting is done using Markdown (including some HTML support), but quoting other posts uses phpBB-style `[quote][/quote]` tags. I have converted the latter into Markdown blockquotes, with a corresponding "header" line on each blockquote identifying and linking the original quoted post back on DPO, leaving pure Markdown. The pages here are rendered from that Markdown - no other editing has been done.

## Thread 57950, "Inclusive Communications Expectations in Python Spaces"

* [Post 7](57950/7.html) - in which I self-identify as potentially neurodivergent
* [Post 23](57950/23.html) - response to Filipe La√≠ns, unsuccessfully seeking empathy
