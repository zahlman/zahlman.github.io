title: My archived posts from discuss.python.org

This is an archive of some posts I made on the Python Discourse forum at https://discuss.python.org (hereafter "DPO"), leading up to [my ban on July 19, 2024](/politics/the_psf/2024-07-31/an-open-letter-to-the-psf-coc-wg.html). Before I was banned, I saved the original Markdown source of my posts locally, expecting some interference.

DPO uses the Discourse forum software, wherein the bulk of post formatting is done using Markdown (including some HTML support), but quoting other posts uses phpBB-style `[quote][/quote]` tags. I have converted the latter into Markdown blockquotes, with a corresponding "header" line on each blockquote identifying and linking the original quoted post back on DPO, leaving pure Markdown. The pages here are rendered from that Markdown - no other editing has been done.

Note that the post IDs shown here are permanent IDs assigned by the Discourse software; they don't change if intervening posts are hidden or even deleted.

## Thread 57950, "Inclusive Communications Expectations in Python Spaces"

This was the main thread where Tim Peters was originally called out.

My local backup included the posts listed here. I apparently also made [post 13](https://discuss.python.org/t/inclusive-communications-expectations-in-python-spaces/57950/13) and [post 16](https://discuss.python.org/t/inclusive-communications-expectations-in-python-spaces/57950/16) (links to DPO directly), although they don't seem particularly interesting in retrospect. Post 23 was hidden, despite being well received by other community members.

* [Post 7](57950/7.html) - In which I self-identify as potentially neurodivergent, and initially defend Tim Peters.
* [Post 23](57950/23.html) - A response to Filipe Laíns (who also thus self-identified), unsuccessfully seeking empathy.
* [Post 28](57950/28.html) - A basic complaint to Brett Cannon about Code of Conduct enforcement.
* [Post 32](57950/32.html) - Explaining my observations of ideological friction in the community - particularly alluding to the exodus of core devs in 2020.

## Thread 58093, "Why I'm leaving discuss.python.org"

This was the thread in which Steve Holden announced his departure from the forum. Of these, only post 77 has been hidden as of August 19, 2024; but my local backup included several more posts, so I added them here anyway.

For completeness, you may also wish to read my other posts, [65](https://discuss.python.org/t/why-im-leaving-discuss-python-org/58093/65) and [68](https://discuss.python.org/t/why-im-leaving-discuss-python-org/58093/68) (links to DPO directly).

* [Post 6](58093/6.html) - In which I describe unclear communication WRT "soft moderation".
* [Post 35](58093/35.html) - Another, more detailed complaint to Brett Cannon, showing the lack of openness and transparency in forum moderation.
* [Post 42](58093/42.html) - Explaining why I consider the Code of Conduct inherently exclusionary, and proposing that even the *existence of* the Code of Conduct Work Group isn't as obvious as it ought to be.
* [Post 54](58093/54.html) - A follow-up to Brett Cannon.
* [Post 57](58093/57.html) - A quick clarification of my position on the Discourse "community moderation" system.
* [Post 77](58093/77.html) - A statement against censorship; also, evidence that the WG's claims of concern for privacy don't hold water.

## Thread 58408, "I'm leaving too"

This was my own departure announcement thread.

Note that post 6 was not only hidden, but actually deleted. Only the OP was allowed to remain publicly visible. The deleted post had received several "hearts" on the forum; as is still publicly visible, the hidden posts were also well received by many.

* [Post 1](58408/1.html) - In which I offer detailed, but general reasoning for my departure.
* [Post 2](58408/2.html) - An examination of the Work Group's "Enforcement Procedures" for the Code of Conduct, whereby claims of "reverse sexism" or "reverse racism" are to be treated as inherently bad-faith. This includes my explanation of why these terms themselves are inappropriate, and a fair amount of documentation of real-world sexism against men.
* [Post 3](58408/3.html) - A general complaint about the discussion in thread 57950, again reiterating the theme of unclear communication. In particular, the way that it was obviously about Tim Peters yet pretended not to be.
* [Post 6](58408/6.html) - A more detailed defense of my position on sexism, as solicited by Stephen Morton's objection, and giving further examples of real-world sexism against men - in particular, observing the sexist nature of standard feminist rhetoric.
* [Post 7](58408/7.html) - The list of "things that made me feel uncomfortable about the discussion" that I promised to Filipe Laíns in the main thread. Notably, this is where I pointed out the original lack of respect for Joannah Nanjekye's views.

## Thread 58588

For completeness, the OP of a meta thread where I complained about moderation applied to the previous thread (aside from posts being hidden, my thread was put in "slow mode" despite that I didn't sense that any particular "heat" to the discussion). This thread, itself, was "unlisted", so it can only be accessed with a direct link.

* [Post 1](58588/1.html) - although unlisted, it can [still be accessed](https://discuss.python.org/t/why-was-slow-mode-applied-to-my-thread-and-my-post-hidden-by-the-community/58588) as of August 19, 2024.
