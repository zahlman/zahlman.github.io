I have used Python extensively, in both personal and professional contexts, since 2005. I also have prior experience with C, C++, C#, Java, Javascript (using jQuery and node.js), Scala (using the Play framework) and more.

While my professional experience has been mainly in game development, I consider myself primarily a tools developer, as well as a Python educator. I especially enjoy making tools that help make sense of complex data (binary data formats or deeply nested JSON) or help create such data from a more human-manageable form.

You can see my Github [here](https://github.com/zahlman). I also post [on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/523612/karl-knechtel).
