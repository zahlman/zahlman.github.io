The main thrust of the series has been that everything is broken or historically has been broken; but I've also been trying to fight some common misconceptions and defend some things that people don't seem to like but which are actually quite reasonable in context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I've been doing this in the shadow of &lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt; existing, and &lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;a href="https://www.star-history.com/#astral-sh/uv&amp;amp;type=date&amp;amp;legend=top-left"&gt;momentum has been unstoppable this year&lt;/a&gt;. Of course there were many adopters in 2024 as well, but we're now seeing more and more evidence in PyPI stats, surveys, CI pipelines etc. that &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1isv37n/is_uv_package_manager_taking_over/"&gt;people are switching&lt;/a&gt; away from &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; (and other tools) to &lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is unsurprising, given how positive the coverage has been overall. There have been &lt;a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=pastYear&amp;amp;page=0&amp;amp;prefix=false&amp;amp;query=uv&amp;amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;amp;type=story"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; popular posts about it on Hacker News this year (I wouldn't mind adding to the pile!) and everyone is touting its features and praising their experience with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So before the year is out, I really wanted to write down some thoughts about &lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt;'s success so far and the impact it's had on me — which as it turns out is mostly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; about actually using it. This will mostly be gathering things that I've already said repeatedly in the aforementioned threads, but I think there's value to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pip 25.0 has what I consider a very serious security vulnerability. In the Python ecosystem, it's normal and expected that third-party packages provide their own, arbitrary "setup" code for installation (for example, to run C compilers in project-specific ways, when the code uses a C extension). But Pip will run such code &lt;em&gt;in many more situations than you might naively expect&lt;/em&gt;. I think it's obvious that running arbitrary code &lt;em&gt;when you aren't expecting it and prepared for it&lt;/em&gt; is a much bigger problem. The user should have a chance to decide whether to trust the code, first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that warnings are more important than baiting people to read the post, so here's the PSA up front:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never use Pip to download, test, "dry-run" etc. an untrusted source distribution (sdist).&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/1884"&gt;It will try to build the package&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;potentially running arbitrary code&lt;/strong&gt; (as building an sdist always entails). Instead, use the &lt;a href="https://pypi.org"&gt;PyPI website&lt;/a&gt; directly, or the &lt;a href="https://docs.pypi.org/api/json/"&gt;API&lt;/a&gt; it provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never use &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt; to run Pip&lt;/strong&gt; (nor run it with administrative privileges on Windows). Aside from the potential problems caused by conflicting with the system package manager, Pip &lt;a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11034"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;will not drop privileges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when it runs as root and attempts to build an sdist - which again, &lt;strong&gt;potentially runs arbitrary code&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you expect wheels to be available for the packages you want to install with Pip, &lt;strong&gt;strongly consider adding &lt;code&gt;--only-binary=:all:&lt;/code&gt; to the Pip command&lt;/strong&gt; to ensure that only wheels are used. If you really need to use sdists, it's wise to inspect them first, which by definition isn't possible with a fully automated installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you release Python packages, &lt;a href="https://pradyunsg.me/blog/2022/12/31/wheels-are-faster-pure-python/"&gt;please try to provide wheels for them&lt;/a&gt;, even if - no, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; if your package includes only Python code and doesn't require explicitly "compiling" anything. An sdist is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; slower to install than a wheel even in these cases, and making a wheel available allows your users to demand wheels from Pip - raising the overall baseline for trust and safety in the Python ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, I did clickbait a bit. This security issue &lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; some new discovery. In fact, it has plagued Pip &lt;em&gt;for its entire history&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please enjoy my detailed analysis below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I'll talk about Pipx's major use cases, its limitations, and how to get more mileage out of it with a few simple tweaks.&lt;/p&gt;
