The main thrust of the series has been that everything is broken or historically has been broken; but I've also been trying to fight some common misconceptions and defend some things that people don't seem to like but which are actually quite reasonable in context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I've been doing this in the shadow of &lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt; existing, and &lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;a href="https://www.star-history.com/#astral-sh/uv&amp;amp;type=date&amp;amp;legend=top-left"&gt;momentum has been unstoppable this year&lt;/a&gt;. Of course there were many adopters in 2024 as well, but we're now seeing more and more evidence in PyPI stats, surveys, CI pipelines etc. that &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1isv37n/is_uv_package_manager_taking_over/"&gt;people are switching&lt;/a&gt; away from &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; (and other tools) to &lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is unsurprising, given how positive the coverage has been overall. There have been &lt;a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=pastYear&amp;amp;page=0&amp;amp;prefix=false&amp;amp;query=uv&amp;amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;amp;type=story"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; popular posts about it on Hacker News this year (I wouldn't mind adding to the pile!) and everyone is touting its features and praising their experience with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So before the year is out, I really wanted to write down some thoughts about &lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt;'s success so far and the impact it's had on me — which as it turns out is mostly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; about actually using it. This will mostly be gathering things that I've already said repeatedly in the aforementioned threads, but I think there's value to that.&lt;/p&gt;
