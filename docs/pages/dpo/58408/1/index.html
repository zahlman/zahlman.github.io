        <p>A little over a year ago (Mar 8, 2023, according to the automated private message in my history), I came here primarily in search of help with what I guessed to be an <a href="https://pypistats.org/packages/turtle">epidemic of Python beginners mistakenly downloading</a> the irrelevant, Python 2.x-specific <code>turtle</code> package from PyPI, hoping either to <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Python#Deviations_from_upstream">fix deliberately restricted</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> Python installations or simply not realizing that it's part of the standard library. I <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/can-tkinter-be-installed-on-a-per-python-installation-basis/25089">asked a technical question</a> that helped inform the advice I <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76105218/">initially gave</a> on Stack Overflow and have since <a href="https://software.codidact.com/posts/291791">rewritten</a> for Codidact. Shortly thereafter I <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/handling-modules-on-pypi-that-are-now-in-the-standard-library/27071/3">saw</a> that others had noted the issue, which was nice.</p>
<p>I ended up sticking around and becoming quite the prolific poster ("2.3k posts created", apparently). And then I got extremely interested in the <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/building-distributions-and-drawing-the-platypus/2062/16">"elephant"</a> (or <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/the-packaging-platypus/1939">is it a platypus?</a>) of Python packaging. To toot my own horn a bit, I <a href="https://discuss.python.org/badges/39/empathetic">became</a> the first (and thus far only) recipient of the forum's "Empathetic" gold badge outside of the CPython core dev team<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>But all of that comes to an end now. The <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/inclusive-communications-expectations-in-python-spaces/57950">recent situation</a> regarding supposed "disturbingly unprofessional conversations", in turn surrounding a <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/for-your-consideration-proposed-bylaws-changes-to-improve-our-membership-experience/55696">controversial proposal</a> for changes to PSF governance (specifically the last of three proposed in that thread), forced me to reconsider my participation here.</p>
<p>I'm now forced to weigh my interest in discussing topics on a forum like this (as opposed to writing about them on a blog and/or explaining them in Q&amp;A form on Codidact), against my impression of the rules here and how they are interpreted and enforced.</p>
<p>And between:</p>
<ul>
<li>various provisions of the Code of Conduct which I previously didn't expect to need to worry about, but now find disagreeable;</li>
<li>the apparent interpretation of those provisions by CoC WG members (as seen both in explicit statements<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> as well as my observations of what does and doesn't get moderated);</li>
<li>the repeated <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/for-your-consideration-proposed-bylaws-changes-to-improve-our-membership-experience/55696/176">lack of clear communication</a> from leadership about a constellation of related issues (including the meta-issue of how this governance is actually structured and who's responsible for what), even <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/for-your-consideration-proposed-bylaws-changes-to-improve-our-membership-experience/55696/167">in supposed attempts at transparency</a>, leading to <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/for-your-consideration-proposed-bylaws-changes-to-improve-our-membership-experience/55696/131">unaddressed speculation</a>;</li>
<li>my general read of the community's most common viewpoints on Code of Conduct issues (as determined by the content of posts, number of likes, style of rhetoric etc.);</li>
<li>various specific things said by other well-recognized and respected community members in the ensuing discussion (I will reply to some of this in a separate post);</li>
<li>mistreatment of <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/inclusive-communications-expectations-in-python-spaces/57950/4">core dev</a> team <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/for-your-consideration-proposed-bylaws-changes-to-improve-our-membership-experience/55696/133">members</a> and <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/why-im-leaving-discuss-python-org/58093">other</a> highly accomplished <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/why-i-am-withdrawing-fellowship-status-in-psf/58301">members</a> of the community, <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/the-psf-should-be-less-political-not-more/4329">past</a> and present;</li>
<li>the emphasis placed on CoC issues <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/for-your-consideration-proposed-bylaws-changes-to-improve-our-membership-experience/55696/130">seemingly at the expense of</a> practical, real-world matters that would offer much greater benefit to those supposedly being protected;</li>
<li>the various <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/seeking-a-consensus-about-the-purpose-and-future-of-pyproject-toml/39763/20">negative interactions</a> I've had with other regulars here (and the fact that <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/seeking-a-consensus-about-the-purpose-and-future-of-pyproject-toml/39763/23">people don't seem to understand why I was upset, or perhaps even <em>that</em> I was upset</a>);</li>
<li>general frustration with the habitual flow of packaging discussions</li>
</ul>
<p>I can no longer see myself participating here in any regular capacity.</p>
<p>I am not deleting my account, but henceforth I will post only in this thread, the threads directly related to the situation... and in the future, perhaps to announce project releases.<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> I absolutely still believe in FOSS and in the Python programming language (even if there are many things I think it does suboptimally), and am certainly not giving up on such development.<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>I have at least three more posts planned for this thread:</p>
<ul>
<li>a more concrete objection to the discussion in the "inclusive communications expectations" thread generally, and how it played out</li>
<li>a <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/inclusive-communications-expectations-in-python-spaces/57950/23">list which I owe</a> to @FFY00</li>
<li>a grab-bag of replies to things said in all of this mess, that I haven't yet managed to incorporate into other posts.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you'll bear with me.</p>
