Just for the record, I personally have no objection to "community moderation" (i.e. content being auto-hidden by flags) in principle, and I recognize that none of you control how the Discourse software fundamentally works (beyond perhaps tweaking some thresholds or disabling certain features, but I don't have a problem with those features).

My primary personal objection, and what is driving me out here, is the overall attitude towards what content is deemed objectionable and what content is not. The lack of transparency doesn't help, but it isn't the most important thing for me.
